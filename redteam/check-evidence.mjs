/**
 * Reports whether the current revision has been scanned.
 *
 * Runs on every push to a pull request and costs one API call, which is the
 * whole trick: the check is cheap and the scan is not, so the check reads
 * evidence rather than producing it.
 *
 * A revision with no matching evidence is reported as `action_required` rather
 * than as a failure. Nothing is known to be wrong with it — nobody has looked —
 * and reporting "unscanned" as "failing" trains people to merge through a red
 * check, which is how a gate stops meaning anything.
