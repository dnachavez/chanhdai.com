/**
 * SHA-bound evidence for the generated scan.
 *
 * The scan is expensive — minutes of wall clock and a few hundred model calls —
 * so it must not re-run on every commit pushed to a pull request. But a check
 * that simply does not run leaves the pull request looking unreviewed, and a
 * check that reports the *last* run regardless of what has changed since is
 * worse: it reports green for code nobody scanned.
 *
 * So the result is recorded against the exact commit it was produced from, in a
 * comment on the pull request, and a cheap check reads it back. Same revision,
 * the stored conclusion stands and nothing re-runs. New commits, the evidence no
 * longer matches and the check says so until someone asks for another scan.
 *
 * The shape is borrowed from the adversarial review in aeva-website, minus the
 * parts this repository has no use for — no publisher signatures and no
 * adjudication. What is kept is the part that matters: evidence binds to a SHA,
 * and the check reflects the evidence rather than the run.
 *
 * Each scan posts its own comment. An earlier version rewrote a single one in
 * place, which kept the pull request tidy at the cost of the only record of what
 * a change had actually fixed — six findings and none left the same comment
 * behind. The newest comment is the one the check reads.
