/**
 * The one model tried if Nemotron cannot be served, via OpenRouter's `models`
 * parameter — routed onward server-side inside the same request.
 *
 * Paid, and that is the entire point. Exactly one provider serves Nemotron, so
 * OpenRouter's usual answer to an outage — route the same model to another host
 * — has nowhere to go, and the SDK's retries only reach the same dead endpoint.
 * A `:free` fallback does not help either: the daily allowance and the
 * per-minute ceiling are both account-wide across every `:free` model, so a
 * refused request is refused again by the alternates. Only a model on a
 * different meter is a real fallback.
 *
 * Costs nothing on a healthy day, because OpenRouter never reaches it while the
 * primary answers. At ~9k tokens a turn it is ~$0.0076 when it does, so even a
 * full day of outage at the site's ceiling of ~330 turns is about $2.50 against
 * a $10 balance that free models never touch.
 *
 * Chosen on measurement rather than price, run against this system prompt
 * through OpenRouter itself. It searched on all three probes including the one
 * about an employer that does not exist, and linked
 * `/experience#position-framework-1` rather than a vaguer anchor.
 *
 * `openai/gpt-oss-120b` is half the price and was rejected for the opposite
 * behaviour on the same probes: it called no tool at all for the employer that
 * does not exist, answering from priors, and wrapped a link in the full-width
 * brackets `normalize-links.ts` exists to repair. That is the third measurement
 * of that family failing this prompt, after `gpt-oss-20b` lost the original
 * comparison and `gpt-oss-120b` did the same when checked on Groq.

 * Budget
 *
 * OpenRouter meters `:free` models by *requests*, not tokens: 20 per minute and
 * 1,000 per day, the daily figure being what the account's one-off $10 credit
 * purchase unlocked — the threshold is measured on credit bought all time, not
 * on a balance, and `:free` models draw none of it down, so it does not lapse.
 * That is a different constraint from the one this feature was built against,
 * and it inverts which numbers matter.
 *
 * Groq's free tier was 8,000 tokens per minute counting input and output
 * together, which made every token in the payload expensive and made a single
 * oversized request fail permanently with a 413. Nothing here is token-bound any
 * more — the model takes 262k of context and the whole corpus is ~13k — so the
 * caps below are set for answer quality rather than to squeeze under a ceiling.
 *
 * What is scarce now is the turn itself. A turn that searches and reads costs
 * three requests, so 1,000 a day is roughly **330 conversations** — enough that
 * the daily cap is no longer the binding limit. The 20 a minute is: about six
 * turns a minute, across every visitor at once.
 *
 * The per-IP limiter is what keeps that minute from belonging to one person.
 * It matters more than the daily figure now, not less.
 *
 * `FALLBACK_MODEL` sits outside all of this. It is paid, so it is metered by
 * balance rather than by either ceiling — which is what makes it useful when
 * the ceilings are exactly the problem.
 *
 * Measured against the alternatives before settling here: Groq's free tier caps
 * tokens rather than requests and could not fit one turn under 8k a minute;
 * Gemini's allows five requests a minute, which is under two turns; and both
 * Together and the paid tiers spend a balance per token rather than unlocking a
 * ceiling once.
